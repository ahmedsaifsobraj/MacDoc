    "review": "This laptop is amazing. Super fast (was immediately ~30% faster at a set of python tests), and I really appreciate the larger screen and improved speakers. The screen feels much, much bigger than the 13. That said, the 15 definitely *feels* more like a laptop. The 13 is small enough that it feels almost feels like a larger tablet device. The 15, while only a half-pound heavier, really does start to feel more like a laptop because of the increased size.",
